# build-stuff

Goal is pretty simple. We are going to build a lot of stuff. Let's get started.

## Lessons

1. Create a web app using the Google Maps API.
  - Display a Google Map that takes up the entire screen.
  - Render a list of markers onto the map.
  - On click of each marker output the markers name and id into the console.
  - **Looking For**
    - Good folder structure and file naming.
    - Well written and formatted JS.
    - Use Node.js web server to serve your files.
  - **Bonus**
    - When a user clicks on the marker create a popup that displays the information about location.


## How to use
- Fork this repo and clone your version down.
- Use git to checkout the branch we are currently working on.
  - **Example**
    - `git checkout app/lesson1` - this will take you to your workspace for lesson1
- In that branch make all of your changes and create a pull request to this repo when you have stuff to show.
- Remember to commit early and commit often.
- Also if the branch doesn't exist create the branch with the naming convention `app/lesson[lesson-number]`.
